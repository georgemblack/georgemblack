# Howdy! ü§†

I am a software engineer working in Chicago, IL.

One of my favorite little side projects is a suite of services I use to run a website.

* [`web`](https://github.com/georgemblack/web): A static site generator (Go)
* [`web-admin`](https://github.com/georgemblack/web-admin): A UI to edit site data (React/Redux)
* [`web-api`](https://github.com/georgemblack/web-api): An API to access site data (Node/Express)
* [`stats-worker`](https://github.com/georgemblack/stats-worker): A Cloudflare worker to collect web views
* [`static-content-worker`](https://github.com/georgemblack/static-content-worker): A Cloudflare worker to host the site
* [`gcs-kv-sync`](https://github.com/georgemblack/gcs-kv-sync): Syncs content from GCS to Cloudflare KV (Python)

This project uses the following tools:

* [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) for storing build output
* [Cloudflare Workers (and KV)](https://workers.cloudflare.com) for edge compute & storage
* [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) (for all other services)

Don't judge it as professional code ‚Äì it's just a fun side thing üòÅ
